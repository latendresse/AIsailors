# AIsailors

The Sailors strategic board game driven by AI.

You are directing a team of five racing sail boats against your opponent, the Computer team with the
same number of boats.  To play a move, you select one sail boat to go forward. The speed of a
sail boat, at 1, 2, or 3 steps, is given by the number of dots of the last departing dock. Your
objective is to get four of your sail boats to the opposite dock, and back, to the starting dock
before your opponent does.  Your opponent will try to stop you by going over your sail boats, which
forces them back to their last departing dock. Likewise, you can hinder your opponent sail boats.

P.S.: If four sail boats make it back, and that team was the first to play, the opponent may draw
the game by one ultimate move to complete four sail boats back. Yes, a draw is possible at
Sailors!
